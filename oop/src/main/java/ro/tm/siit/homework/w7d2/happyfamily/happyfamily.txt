Write a program tells if a person or a family is happy. Model a Person class with a name which is never happy, then add subclasses for Man, Woman.
 A Family is made of a hustband and a wife and they could have one or many children.
 A happy family is a family where every person in it is happy.

A man is happy if he has good grades and a play station (when age under 18), when he has a girlfriend or married and coolest gadgets (when over 18).

A woman is happy if she has good grades and girlfriends (under age 18), has boyfriend and a career (age 18-30), if she is married and has kid/s (over age 30).

End goal: model with OOP and use polymorphism to create clear and clean code. Consider having an idenity/name for each entity.
 The family takes the identity of both husband and wife combined.

1. create the appropriate abstractions - whicht are those?

2. consider each abstraction and add relevant data/instance variables and operations/methods - which are those? consider is-a(inheritance) vs has-a(association)

3. create the necessary constructors for each class

4. create an application which creates multiple persons, creates families and add kids to them.
 In the end scan through all families and check if it's a happy family and then check every single person if it is happy or not (single person has age over 18!, so kids excluded);
  hint: make use of polymorphism while scanning through.
